Could you solve this task please:

1. There is famous problem of inductive logic:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction
It is always probable that wrong hypothesis will be chosen.
Are you agree with that?

2. All police or private investigation are inductive investigations.
Investigator gather facts and choose hypothesis who is the murderer for example.
Investigator is maximizing the following: arg max r (h | D), h in H,
where H - all possible hypothesis who is the murderer.
Are you agree with that?

3. So, we can conclude that due to the properties of the inductive logic itself
there is always uncertain that police is catching innocent people.
Are you agree with that?

4. Also the most probable hypothesis is that the police is the murderer.
They are professionals. All amateurs are walking to them with the ideas,
detailed instructions and patents.
Are you agree with that?

5. All crime are artifacts. It is always something crafted. By someone.
Someone can ask for help.

6. And there are a lot of travelers in the modern era. Almost
everyone could be a murderer.

Is it all correct?

What can do policeman if he or she found murdered young women in the woods?
- do some sort of inductive investigate. which may lead to the wronf suspect.
- apply gun.

But young woman see murderer. And she can apply gun also if she has an
opportunity to buy one. So why she has not?

## Purpose of This Repository

The **Armbian Linux Build Framework** creates customizable OS images based on **Debian** or **Ubuntu** for **single-board computers (SBCs)** and embedded devices.

It builds a complete Linux system including kernel, bootloader, and root filesystem, giving you control over versions, configuration, firmware, device trees, and system optimizations.

The framework supports **native**, **cross**, and **containerized** builds for multiple architectures (`x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armhf`, `riscv64`) and is suitable for development, testing, production, or automation.

> **Looking for prebuilt images?** Use [Armbian Imager](https://github.com/armbian/imager/releases) — the easiest way to download and flash Armbian to your SD card or USB drive. Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/armbian/build
